Environmental Efficiency & Industry Benchmarking (PostgreSQL)

Overview  
This project was created to analyze the environmental and business efficency of facilities and corporations using some form of toxin or waste in their processes. Data obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) to evaluate how industrial facilities and parent companies compare relative to their industry peers and their impact on the U.S landscape. Using PostgreSQL, I built a normalized relational database and a set of analytical views that benchmark air emissions, waste recycling, and energy recovery across industries, toxins & chemicals, facilities, and parent companies.

Dataset
Source: EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
Year: 2024
Scope: U.S. industrial facilities reporting air emissions, waste recycling, treatment, and energy recovery
Limitations: Single-year snapshot
Not simultanously specifc and broad (no dioxins 1 - 9, no surface injection data, etc)

Database Design

Core Tables  
facility: facility-level identifiers, NAICS industry classifications    
chemical: the specific chemicals being reported, and their characteristics in terms of toxicity  
emissions: reported environmental quantities such air emissions, proper waste management, and energy recovery  
parent_company: ownership relationships between facilities and companies  

Analytical Tables
industry_benchmarks: industry-level averages across differing metrics and tables 
certifying_official: unique identifier of officials provided by the EPA as well as public information  

Industry Classifications  
Facilities are grouped into the following sectors:
Organic Chemical Manufacturing
Agriculture/Livestock
Food & Beverage Manufacturing
Sewage Treatment Facilities
Solid Waste/Landfills
NAICS codes were mapped to industry names to enable interpretable benchmarking.

Key Views & Metrics

facility_vs_industry  
Compares individual facilities to their industry averages  
Relative air emissions  
Relative waste recycling  
Absolute environmental outputs  
This allows identification of facilities that over or under perform relative to others across the nation or within class.

parent_company_efficiency     
Aggregates environmental performance across all facilities owned by a parent company  
Total emissions and recycling  
Average emissions per facility  
Displays the relative performance of each corporation versus their industry benchmarks  

industry_revenue_efficiency  
Analyzes the amount of revenue generated by each industry per unit of emission  
Average revenue per facility  
Average air emissions  
Revenue per unit of emission  
A summarization shows which industry is more environmentally efficent by correlating their emissions to revenue  


Example Insights  
Large companies and corporations may emit more in absolute terms but perform efficiently on the facility level  
Certain industries show strong recycling performance but poor air emissions efficiency  

Tools & Technologies
